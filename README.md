# Adventure Game
## Starting position of the game
The top left of the screen shows the lives (5 by default). The character moves with the arrows on your keyboard. The path and the decoration were placed/positioned by me.

## Boundary
The outside of the map and this water are boundaries, so the character can't run over it

## Spikes
There are also spikes that reduce your lives by one.
